About
=====

phpcs-security-audit is a set of [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) rules that finds flaws or weaknesses related to security in PHP and its popular frameworks.

It currently has core PHP rules as well as Drupal 7 specific rules. Next planned CMS/Framework is Symfony 2.

As a bonus set of rules, the tool also check for CVE issues and security advisories related to CMS/Framework. You can use it in order to follow the versionning of components 

The main reasons of this project behing an extension of PHP_CodeSniffer is to have easy integration into continuous integration systems and being able to find security bugs that are not detected with object oriented analysis (like in [RIPS](http://rips-scanner.sourceforge.net/) or [PHPMD](http://phpmd.org/)).

phpcs-security-audit is backed by [Ph√©romone](http://www.pheromone.ca/) and written by [Jonathan Marcil](http://www.jonathanmarcil.ca/).


Usage
=====

You need http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/ installed first.

Then all you need to do is to configure or use a XML rule file and run it over your code.

```
phpcs --extensions=php,inc,lib,module,info --standard=example_base_ruleset.xml /your/php/files/
```

Specifying extensions is important since for example PHP code is within .module files in Drupal.

If you want to integrate it all with Jenkins, go see http://jenkins-php.org/ for extensive help.


Customize
=========
As in normal PHP CodeSniffer rules, customization is provided in the XML files that are in the top folder of the project.

The `example_subset_ruleset.xml` file will give you all the choice possible and let you customize them of removing the ones you don't like.

Theses parameters are common in many rules (this is a PHP CodeSniffer limitation, sorry for redundency):
* ParanoiaMode: set to 1 to add more checks. 0 for less.
* CmsFramework: set to the name of a folder containings rules and Utils.php (such as Drupal7, Symfony2).


Specialize
==========

If you want to fork and help or just do your own sniffs you can use the utilities provided by phpcs-security-audit rules in order to facilitate the process.

Let's say you have a function that is taking user input from `$_GET` with a function call to `get_param()`.

You have to create a new Folder in Sniffs/ that will be the name of your framework. Then you'll need
to create a file named Utils.php that will actually be the function that will specialise the generic sniffs. To guide you, just copy the file from another folder such as Drupal7/.

The main function you'll want to change is `is_direct_user_input` where you'll want to return TRUE when `get_param()` is seen:
```php
	public static function is_direct_user_input($var) {
		if (parent::is_direct_user_input($var)) {
			return TRUE;
		} else {
			if ($var == 'get_param') {
				return TRUE;
			}
		}
		return FALSE;
	}
```

Don't forget to set the occurence of param "CmsFramework" in your XML base configuration in order to select your newly added utilities.

You are not required to do your own sniffs for the customization to work, but you could use the newly
created directory to do so.

If you implements any public cms/framework customization please make a pull request to help the project grows.
